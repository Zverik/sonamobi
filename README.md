# Sõnamobi

Mobile user interface for accessing [Sõnaveeb](https://sonaveeb.ee/) dictionary.
Online only. It fetches raw html pages and preprocesses them for displaying.

Why is it better:

* Less requests and caching, hence faster answers.
* Easy to operate with one hand.
* Words forms are easier accessible.
* Translate definitions and examples with a tap.
* History and bookmarks.
* Dark mode.
* No tracking.

The app is not authorized by EKI, it's an independent work.
